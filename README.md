# ToyRover
Toy Rover demo project

# Starting Up
This project has been created to use UV as its package manager. Installing UV is detailed [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_1), but the section 'Installing UV' outlines the necessary steps. Once installed a terminal restart is required.

Once UV is installed, the project dependencies can be acquired by running `uv sync`. The program can then be run by executing `uv run main`
